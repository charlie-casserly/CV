I've played electric guitar since I was a teenager and started taking piano lessons two years ago. I'm also an avid gamer, so if I'm not slapping keys on my piano I'll be found slapping buttons on a controller of some sort. I recently tried to take up skateboarding but it hurt a lot so I gave up. Always trying new things!
