Under Construction

<strike>A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what excites you about tech.</strike>

I am an ambitious Junior Developer, recent graduate of Makers Academy, with previous experience in Electrical Installation and Maintenance. I am passionate about both problem solving and tech and I am very excited to land a role where I can challenge myself and extend my programming knowledge.
I am hoping to find a role in the tech industry in or around London, where I can further expand my knowledge in Full-Stack development.
